# Bidirectional-DC-DC-Converter-for-Electric-Vehicles-EVs-
This repository documents the design, modeling, and simulation of a bidirectional DC-DC converter intended for electric vehicle (EV) power management applications, enabling efficient two-way energy transfer between EV battery systems and external loads or the power grid.

The project focuses on supporting both charging and discharging modes through integrated buck and boost converter operation, allowing adaptability to varying battery voltages and load conditions. Special emphasis was placed on advanced energy exchange functionalities such as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) charging to enhance grid stability and energy resilience.

Key highlights include:

1.Design and implementation of a bidirectional DC-DC converter architecture for EV applications

2.Support for both buck and boost operating modes to enable flexible power flow control

3.Integration of V2G and V2V capabilities for bidirectional energy exchange

4.Development and simulation of the complete converter model using MATLAB/Simulink

5.Performance validation focused on efficiency, voltage regulation, and system stability
